Generalization-Env Config
##########################


We assume that you only want to use built-in functions instead of developing some new features, and thus
provide a list for you to learn more about the meaning of each configuration options in **PGDriveEnv (**PGDriveEnv**).

PGDriveEnv Config
###########################

We do generalization experiments under the default setting of PGDriveEnv. To reproduce our experiment results,
no special configuration is needed.

However, PGDrive can also support other research topics, and we will simply introduce the meaning of some configuration
options of PGDriveEnv.

Draw Scene & Visualization
###########################

    - use_render(bool): Pop a window on your screen or not
    - use_image(bool): When you want to access the image of camera, it should be set to True.
    - force_fps(Union[int, None]): Decide the render fps. "None" means that no fps limitation.
    - debug(bool): For developing use, draw the scene with bounding box

Manual Control
################

    - controller(str): "joystick" or "keyboard". Controlling vehicle by joystick is more recommended.
    - manual_control(bool): Controllers above are available only when this flag is True
    - use_chase_camera(bool): A perspective like racing game. usually True, when manual control
    - camera_height(float): Chase camera height

Traffic Config
#################

    - traffic_density(float): vehicle number per 10 meter, aiming to adjust the number of vehicle on road
    - traffic_mode: trigger mode (Add_once) / reborn mode (Reborn). In Reborn mode vehicles will
        enter the map again after arriving its destination

Map Config
#############

    - GenerateMethod: The map can be generated by BIG according to BLOCK_NUM, BLOCK_SEQUENCE, or MAP_FILE
    - GenerateConfig: A int telling BIG the total block number under BLOCK_NUM mode, or a str describing BLOCK_SEQUENCE
        (each block has a unique character severing as its ID, so combining them to get a map, the parameters of these block
        is sampled by BIG), and under MAP_FILE mode the config should be a dict describing the whole map.

Generalization Environment Config
##################################

    - start_seed(int): Random seed of first map.
    - environment_num(int): Number of environments. BIG generates map by a random generator initialized by a specific seed.
        Therefore, "environment_num" maps are generated by seeds \[seed for seed in range(start_seed,
        start_seed+environment_num)\]

Observation Config
######################

    - use_image(bool): If you want to use camera data, please set this to True.
    - rgb_clip(bool): Squeeze the value between \[0, 255\] to \[0.0, 1.0\]
    - vehicle_config(dict): Sensor parameters for vehicle
    - image_source(str): decided which camera image to use (mini_map or front camera). Now we only support capture one image as a part of
        observation.

Action Config
#######################

    - decision_repeat(int): The minimal step size of the world is 2e-2 second, and thus for agent the world will step
        decision_repeat * 2e-2 second after applying one action or step.


Reward Scheme
####################

    - Coefficient of different kinds of reward to describe the driving goal
    - Find more information by accessing our source code in PGDriveEnv
    - You can adjust our primitive reward function or design your own reward function

Etc.
##########

    - use_increment_steering(bool): Keyboard manual control is not linear, but set this value to True can use a linear
        manual control
    - action_check(bool): Check whether the value of action computed by well-trained agent is between \[0.0, 1.0\] or not.
    - pg_world_config(dict): Some basic settings for low level physics world. More information can be found in source code.
