Welcome to the PGDrive documentation. PGDrive is an open-ended driving simulator with infinite scenes.
The key features of PGDrive includes:

- **Lightweight**: Extremely easy to download, install and run in almost all platform.
- **Realistic**: Accurate physics simulation and multiple sensory input including RGB camera, Lidar and sensory data.
- **Efficient**: Up to 500 simulation step per second.
- **Open-ended**: Support generating infinite scenes and configuring various traffic, vehicle, and environmental settings.

This documentation let you get familiar with the installation and basic utilization of PGDrive.
Please go through :doc:`install` to install PGDrive and try the examples in :doc:`get_start` to enjoy PGDrive!

Interesting experiment results can be found in `our paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13681>`_.
