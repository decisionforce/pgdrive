# PGDrive: an open-ended driving simulator with procedural generation

Please install PGDrive via:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/decisionforce/pgdrive.git
```

or you can install via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decisionforce/pgdrive.git
cd pgdrive
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Please run the following line to drive the car in the environment manually with keyboard!

```bash
python -m pgdrive.examples.manual_control
```

You can also enjoy a journey carrying out by our professional driver pretrained from reinforcement learning! 

Note that this script requires your system to have the capacity of rendering. Please refer to the installation guideline for more information.

```bash
python -m pgdrive.examples.enjoy_journey
```

*Note that the above two scripts can not be run in headless machine.*

Running the following line allows you to draw the generated maps:

```bash
python -m pgdrive.examples.draw_maps
```

To build the environment in python script, you can simply run:

```python
import pgdrive  # Import this package to register the environment!
import gym

env = gym.make("PGDrive-v0", config=dict(use_render=True))
env.reset()
for i in range(1000):
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())  # Use random policy
    env.render()
    if done:
        env.reset()
env.close()
```

We also prepare a Colab which demonstrates some basic usage of PGDrive as follows:

## Predefined environment sets

We also define several Gym environment names, so user can start training in the minimalist manner:

```python
import gym
import pgdrive  # Register the environment
env = gym.make("PGDrive-v0")
```

The following table presents some predefined environment names. 

| Gym Environment Name   | Random Seed Range | Number of Maps | Comments                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PGDrive-test-v0`       | [0, 200)          | 200            | Test set, not change for all experiments.               |
| `PGDrive-validation-v0` | [200, 1000)       | 800            | Validation set.                                         |
| `PGDrive-v0`            | [1000, 1100)      | 100            | Default training setting, for quick start.              |
| `PGDrive-10envs-v0`            | [1000, 1100)      | 10            | Training environment with 10 maps.              |
| `PGDrive-1000envs-v0`            | [1000, 1100)      | 1000            | Training environment with 1000 maps.              |
| `PGDrive-training0-v0`  | [3000, 4000)      | 1000           | First set of 1000 environments.                         |
| `PGDrive-training1-v0`  | [5000, 6000)      | 1000           | Second set of 1000 environments.                        |
| `PGDrive-training2-v0`  | [7000, 8000)      | 1000           | Thirds set of 1000 environments.                        |
| ...                          |                   |                | *More map set can be added in response to the requests* |
